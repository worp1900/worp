# worp
A small CLI utility library I am playing around with to wrap my fingers around go.

**Install**

1. Clone the repository to your go workspace (check your $GOPATH env var where yours is located, mine is ~/workspaces/go. So I would run `$ git clone git@github.com:worp1900/worp.git ~/workspaces/go/src/github.com/worp1900/worp` ).
2. Then run `go install github.com/worp1900/worp` to install the binaries.
3. Finally, to execute worp, run `$ worp --help` to see all command available.

Credit where credit is due!
